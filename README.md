# VIM Life

This series of posts will teach you how to use vim, one day at a time. 

The goal of this series is to get you up and running with VIM, and increase your mastery of this powerful editor, one day at a time. After reading *Day 0* and *Day 1*, you will be able to use vim for basic editing. Every following day, you will learn more powerful features until you reach VIM Mastery. 

You can take this *course* at your own pace, starting new days as you want, going back and forward as you like.
